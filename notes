disk sectors:

0: bootsector
1: bootloader continued (sorta like kernel)
2: /root/ folder
3...127: fs



fs:
64kb
128 sectors (512 bytes/sector)


everything is a file

folders can hold up to 64 sub directories or files
each entry is 8 bytes:
    first byte for flags (is directory, is executable...)
    second byte for sector #
    last 6 for file name




boot process:
    display loading message
    clear screen & set vga mode
    load other sectors of bootloader/kernel
    display welcome message
    start terminal


on enter command:
    check if app is built into kernel (smaller apps or those that rely on kernel functions)
    // eventually add aliases as well (check /alias file)

    open /apps/ to memory
    search for entered command in /apps/

    if found, save the sector #
    close /apps/
    open that file from the sector #

    jump to that file at line 0
    on exit, jump to specific label in kernel
    close file
